I really had a blast creating the game! There were so many aspects I wanted to cover in the video, but time constraints held me back. Despite the game seeming straightforward to code, I ran into several challenges. While I managed to display cards using sprite classes, I struggled to make them movable with the same approach. This forced me to put on my thinking cap to find a solution for card movement. Another big hurdle was ensuring that the played card stayed centered for four seconds. Additionally, crafting AI for the bots proved to be quite the task, consuming around 24 hours of my time. And, in the last I had to take numeric input in the gane which was also a challange in itself. the gameOn the flip side, I found immense satisfaction in coding the endgame logic, calculating player points, and declaring the winner. Plus, I thoroughly enjoyed incorporating input directly into the pygame environment instead of relying solely on the terminal.
