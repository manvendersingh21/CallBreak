I enjoyed making the game a lot. There were a lot of things I wanted to discuss in the video but I was not able to discuss them because of the  shortage of time.
**This game seems to be easy code but it is not**
**Difficulties I Faced**
In YouTube videos, people displayed their cards using sprite classes, I was able to display my cards using sprite classes but I was not able to move my card using sprite classes, then I had to use a lot of mind to figure out how to move cards, and the card which I want to.
The next biggest challenge for me was to keep the card in the center that was played for 4 seconds. 
I had also a problem creating a brain of Bots, it took me around 24 hours to make bots play the card.
**Things I enjoyed**
The most thing I enjoyed in the game was to code the end part of the game when I had to calculate the points of the players and tell who is the winner.
And, I also loved adding input in the pygame only not in the terminal.
